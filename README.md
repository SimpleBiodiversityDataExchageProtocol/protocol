Simple Bio Data Exchange Protocol
=================================

This repository should host the protocol which gets developed by the ideas of the 
workshop "Standards f√ºr den Austausch von Beobachtungsdaten von Organismen" held in Bonn, Germany on the 2nd and 3rd May 2018.

Target of this protocol
-----------------------

The intention of the protocol is to share species observation data between different platforms. This sounds simple, but because of very heterogeneous
data structure in different platforms this problem has not been solved generally yet.

The different data structure is a result of different needs for different species groups and different questions the platforms aim to answer.

Approach
--------

The approach of this protocol is not to solve or even support these differences - the approach is to provide a solution for the most simple use cases first. This might be the base of a more advanced, and feature rich protocol at a later time.

Another approach is to use already defined standards where they are available, or simplify them to our needs.

Use cases
---------

  * Provide distribution information to create distribution maps
  * Creating species lists for an area
  * Preparation of "Red Data Books"
  * Provide lists to fight invasive species
